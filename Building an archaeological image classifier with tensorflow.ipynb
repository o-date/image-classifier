What we are doing is adding another layer to the model that takes what the model has already learned about the world and gives it just a bit more information about our particular use-case. If we use the Inception-v3 model, that means we're adding (2048 x n categories) model parameters corresponding to weights in the network. If we use the Mobilenet architecture, which 'sees' only 1001 dimensions, that means we're adding (1001 x n categories) model parameters. We're going to use mobilenet, which has\n",

Otherwise we’ll get an error message. Note also that we’re only training for 500 steps; more steps will generally get better results (but diminishing returns also apply). So we'll add this flag:\n",
