This binder/repo is based on the [Tensorflow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) tutorial. 

As a demonstration, it already contains a small gallery of training images and a few images on which you may test the classifier once it is trained. If you wish to build a more complete classifier, try using the data retrieved by the [R script that downloads image data from the Portable Antiquities Scheme](https://github.com/o-date/notebooks-archdata).
